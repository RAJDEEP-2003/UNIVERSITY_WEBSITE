            <h1>India's Biggest University</h1>
            <p>Leading modern universities are a far cry from the first universities of long ago, when they were just becoming established as learning institutions. The first universities had difficulty surviving without donors, while today many of these institutions of higher learning are money-making machines. Some major universities have established separate university campuses to accommodate students and to offer a more diverse range of topics. These include undergraduate, postgraduate, and distance online students from local areas, and also from different countries abroad. The largest universities in the world are listed below.</p>
